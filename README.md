Making a calorie counting app! Trying to make it as simple as possible, the goal is to make tracking your calories easier. 

This app will not provide crazy features such as putting specific foods, and giving out calories. 

It will be the responsibility of the user to calculate their own meal's calories manually, but this app will allow to easily enter those calories and keep track of them.

The app will also have features such as:
- Daily, weekly, biweekly, and monthly total calories
- Allows inputs for desired goal calories to calculate net gains/losses.
- Calculator for potential calorie gains/losses based on any caloric routine. 
- More to come as this app progresses!
